# Software Development Rules

[1] When in doubt, **index**

> Indexing data makes for faster requests when fetching data from databases. Specifying desired order of elements in your indexes keeps the database from sorting your data upon request.

[2] Minify assets whenever possible

> Make sure all your assets are minified by your server before sent to the client. When scaling, significant amounts of bandwidth will be saved.
